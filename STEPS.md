# Mineswipper-API development steps

## Requirements analysis and priorization

1. Tasks and priorities seems to be clear and priorities are given. As
   suggested, I will put a limit of 5 hours to spent in the project,
   measuring development time with Pomodoro technique.

## Development

### Design and implement a documented RESTful API for the game (think of a mobile app for your API)

For this step I will use a Swagger plugin since it helps me to document the API
along with drafts of structs and methods. There is a useful plugin for Golang
to do this: [swag][1].
